###Stack:

* HTML/LESS/Photoshop
* Javascript/Jquery


OnionOrNot was created by [Luiz](https://github.com/Luiz-N) and [Devon](https://github.com/raddevon) as a collaborative [Thinkful](www.thinkful.com) project.
This was a fun educatoinal project for the both of us and was our first time doing a deep dive into front end technologies.
Luiz did most of the design/html/css including the mobile version while Devon did the heart of the javascript/ajax.

###Points of Interest:

* Ajax is used to pull the headlines however for simplicity's sake the headlines were hardcoded into a static json file. (future versions could make this dynamic)
* None of the animations use jquery.animate. (all css translations; this turned out not being a trivial problem)
* The background image was originally [this](http://www.flagstaffotos.com.au/gallery23/main.php?g2_view=keyalbum.KeywordAlbum&g2_keyword=Onion)
* Completely responsive design
* It actually turned out to be more difficult to find believable Onion headlines than to find hard-to-believe real ones.
